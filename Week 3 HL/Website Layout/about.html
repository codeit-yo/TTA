My professional background includes a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Creative Writing from UC Davis, a Doctorate in Creative Writing from UC Davis, and my certificate as a writer.

                        <p>Our goal is to help people who want to express themselves through art. Our goal as a professional artist is not only inspiring our clients with original work, but also developing their imagination in regards artistic vision. What excites us most? A new client comes into our studio one day, telling him or her how much he enjoys painting, drawing, making sculpture, sculpting, woodworking, writing poetry, music etc., so we always keep going!</p>
